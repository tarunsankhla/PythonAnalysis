COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python

In this project, I preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis using Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scatterplots. So I worked on the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country and also dataset consists of various life factors, and merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.
So from this analysis, we can conclude that the rate of spread of the virus is more in developed countries comparing to undeveloped but this analysis might have some limitations and the drawbacks are that an undeveloped country not occupied with essential health care service to measure or test the COVID patient.
